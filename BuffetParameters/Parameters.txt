Here are the **qualitative (text-based) criteria** that Buffett and Graham evaluate—things you must research manually by reading reports, articles, and using judgment:

## 🏰 ECONOMIC MOAT / COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### **1. Type of Moat**
Read to identify what protects the business from competition:

**Brand Power:**
- Do customers specifically ask for this brand by name?
- Would customers pay more for this brand vs. generic?
- Examples: Coca-Cola, Apple, Nike, Disney

**Network Effects:**
- Does the product become more valuable as more people use it?
- Examples: Credit cards (Visa/Mastercard), Facebook, eBay, Airbnb

**Cost Advantages:**
- Can they produce cheaper than anyone else due to scale, location, or technology?
- Examples: Costco, Geico, Walmart

**Switching Costs:**
- How painful/expensive is it for customers to switch to competitors?
- Examples: Banks, enterprise software (Microsoft, Oracle), medical devices

**Regulatory/Legal Barriers:**
- Do licenses, patents, or regulations prevent competition?
- Examples: Utilities, waste management, pharmaceutical patents

**Intangible Assets:**
- Patents, licenses, government approvals that can't be replicated
- Examples: Drug patents, FCC licenses, mining rights

### **2. Moat Width and Durability**
- Is the moat getting **wider** (strengthening) or **narrower** (weakening)?
- Will this advantage still exist in 10-20 years?
- Can competitors easily copy this in 5 years?

## 👔 MANAGEMENT QUALITY

### **3. Integrity and Honesty**
Read annual reports and letters to shareholders:
- Does management admit mistakes openly?
- Do they take responsibility for failures?
- Do they explain bad news clearly or hide it in jargon?
- Have there been any scandals, restatements, or SEC investigations?

**Red flags:**
- Frequent restatements of earnings
- Overly optimistic projections that never materialize
- Blaming external factors constantly
- Legal/ethical issues

### **4. Owner-Oriented Mindset**
- Do they think like owners or hired managers?
- Do they discuss long-term value creation or just quarterly earnings?
- Do they refer to "shareholders" or "stakeholders"?
- Do they make decisions you would make if you owned 100% of the company?

### **5. Capital Allocation Skills**
Read about their track record:
- Do they make smart acquisitions or destroy value through bad M&A?
- Do they buy back stock when undervalued (good) or overvalued (bad)?
- Do they invest in high-return projects or waste cash on ego projects?
- Do they pay dividends sensibly or hoard cash needlessly?

**Look for:**
- History of successful acquisitions
- Disciplined buyback programs
- Rational dividend policies
- Avoiding empire-building

### **6. Compensation Structure**
Read proxy statements:
- Is executive pay reasonable or excessive?
- Is it tied to long-term performance or short-term metrics?
- Do executives own significant stock (skin in the game)?
- Are stock options diluting shareholders?

**Red flags:**
- Lavish perks (private jets, country club memberships)
- Golden parachutes
- Pay not tied to performance
- Executives selling stock constantly

### **7. Management Tenure and Stability**
- Has leadership been stable or is there constant turnover?
- Does CEO have a long successful track record?
- Is there a clear succession plan?

## 🏢 BUSINESS MODEL & INDUSTRY

### **8. Business Simplicity**
- Can you explain how the company makes money in 2-3 sentences?
- Would a child understand the business?
- Does it require deep technical expertise you don't have?

**Buffett avoids:**
- Complex financial engineering
- Businesses he can't understand
- Rapidly changing technology he can't predict

### **9. Product/Service Necessity**
- Is this a "need" or a "want"?
- Will customers still buy during recessions?
- Is demand growing, stable, or declining?

**Categories:**
- **Essential:** Food, utilities, healthcare, insurance
- **Discretionary but sticky:** Entertainment with pricing power, luxury with brand moat
- **Risky:** Fads, technology products with short life cycles

### **10. Customer Concentration**
Read 10-K filings:
- Is revenue diversified or dependent on few customers?
- If top 3 customers left, would company survive?

**Red flag:** >50% revenue from one or two customers

### **11. Supplier Dependence**
- Is company dependent on a single supplier or commodity?
- Can suppliers raise prices and squeeze margins?

**Example:** Airlines depend on oil prices (bad). Software companies have minimal supplier risk (good).

### **12. Industry Structure**
Research the competitive landscape:
- How many competitors exist?
- Is it a fragmented market or oligopoly?
- Are there high barriers to entry?
- Is industry growing, mature, or declining?

**Buffett prefers:**
- Oligopolies (2-5 major players)
- High barriers to entry
- Rational competition (not price wars)
- Growing or stable markets

### **13. Technological Disruption Risk**
- Could new technology make this business obsolete?
- How quickly does technology change in this industry?

**Examples:**
- Low risk: Coca-Cola, railroads, utilities
- High risk: Consumer electronics, retail, media

### **14. Regulatory Risk**
- Is the business subject to heavy regulation?
- Could regulation change and destroy the business model?
- Does it depend on government contracts?

- Energy (environmental regulations)
- Tobacco, gambling, alcohol

## 📊 ACCOUNTING & TRANSPARENCY

### **15. Accounting Conservatism**
Read the notes to financial statements:
- Does company use aggressive or conservative accounting?
- Are they pushing revenue recognition boundaries?
- How do they handle depreciation, reserves, and write-offs?

**Red flags:**
- Frequent "one-time" charges (should be rare)
- Changing accounting methods
- Revenue recognized before cash collected
- Capitalizing expenses that should be expensed

### **16. Footnotes and MD&A Quality**
Read Management Discussion & Analysis section:
- Is it clear and candid or full of jargon?
- Do they discuss risks honestly?
- Are footnotes transparent or hiding problems?

**Buffett says:** "Read the footnotes"

### **17. Off-Balance Sheet Items**
- Are there hidden liabilities (leases, guarantees, contingencies)?

- Are pension obligations underfunded?

## 🤝 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

## 💼 SHAREHOLDER TREATMENT

### **21. Communication Quality**
Read shareholder letters:
- Is management forthcoming and transparent?
- Do they educate shareholders about the business?
- Do they set realistic expectations?

**Buffett's letters are the gold standard**—educational, honest, humble.

### **22. Share Buyback Philosophy**
- Do they buy back stock opportunistically when undervalued?
- Or do they buy at any price to hit EPS targets?
- Read management commentary on buybacks

**Good:** "We bought back shares because they traded below intrinsic value"
**Bad:** "We returned $X billion to shareholders" (without discussing price paid)

### **23. Dividend Philosophy**
- Is dividend policy rational and sustainable?
- Do they increase dividends sensibly?
- Or do they pay unsustainable dividends to prop up stock price?

### **24. M&A Track Record**
Research past acquisitions:

- Do they overpay for ego deals?
- Do they integrate acquisitions well?

**Red flags:**

### **27. Pricing Power Testing**
Read earnings calls and reports:
- Has company successfully raised prices without losing customers?
- Do they discuss price increases in earnings calls?
- Can they pass cost increases to customers?

**Test:** If they raised prices 10% tomorrow, would customers leave?

## 🎯 CORPORATE CULTURE

### **28. Employee Treatment**
Research company reviews (Glassdoor, etc.):
- Do employees speak highly of management?
- Low or high turnover?
- Are employees engaged and motivated?

**Buffett says:** Companies that treat employees well treat shareholders well

### **29. Customer Satisfaction**
- Are customers loyal and happy?
- High or low customer churn?
- Net Promoter Score (if disclosed)?

### **30. Corporate Values**

## 📝 THE BUFFETT QUALITATIVE CHECKLIST

Before buying, answer these:

**Bottom line:** Numbers get you candidates. Qualitative analysis determines if you actually invest. Buffett spends 80% of his time on qualitative research and 20% on numbers. Most investors do the opposite—that's why they fail.
