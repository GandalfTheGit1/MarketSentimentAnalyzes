203. Also everyone knows that GPUs and even SSDs have life expectancy of a few years.
204. Deepseek R1 doesn’t need Nvidia GPUs for inference and is more than enough for most companies, given most still struggle with just getting clean usable data despite this being a solved problem for decades.
205. In ten years, there may be competitors that can dethrone NVDA. In the next 5? Not a chance in hell.
206. Just about everything related to machine learning is written to run on CUDA as well, the back end software stack is absolutely huge to support it and it's all written and optimised by and for Nvidia over many many years.
207. GTC 2025 is the next big thing to watch.
208. Short-term, the stock might wobble, but long-term prospects look juicy.
209. The confusing part is that Google’s TPU ecosystem isn’t even close to replacing Nvidia at scale today. Not even remotely.
210. But the fear was enough to push NVDA down like it’s some tiny speculative stock.
211. I’m extremely confident nvidia beats earnings and goes up.
212. Also that guy with $NVDA puts is dead broke.
213. NVDA being the new reputable blue chip stock when we have no clue where AI is going is scary.
214. To put things in perspective, with a 3.9% increase Nvidia’s market cap rose more today alone than the combined total profit that Nvidia has earned since the company was created in 1993.
215. I remember all those bears claiming DeepSeek and China will be the end for Nvidia.
216. Or the market cap lunatics that don’t look at fundamentals and solely focus on the stock price.
217. Kind of silent these days.
218. Yeah dude, NVDA is in full beast mode again and honestly it’s kinda insane.
219. US and China meet Monday to discuss trade.
220. China may dangle rare earth minerals in front of the US in exchange for some kind of chips from NVDA, even if they are dumbed down.
221. NVDA could also trade in sympathy with any good news coming out of that meeting.
222. You would have some big balls to short NVDA IMHO.
223. CUDA software platform.
224. AMD is not industry standard and assuming all future projects keep using NVDA due to their technology advantage, AMD will slowly lose its 3% AI and data center market share overtime.
225. Now I do believe there is some huge upside to AMD as well but it will not overshadow NVDA because NVDA is sector leader.
226. It's likely that production capacity may really be the limiting reagent for 2025 revenues not demand.
227. Market is forward looking and there is uncertainity on 2026+ revenues (DeepSeek is one of them) - markets don't like that.<|control12|>1. Nvidia revenue insanely strong.
